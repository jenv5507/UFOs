# UFO Sightings

**Overview of Project**

The purpose of this project was to provide a webpage that contains UFO sightings.  In addition to not only providing the detail, you are able to filter the data by date, city, state, country and the shape of the sighting.

**Results**

For those that are interested in looking at specific data based on certain criteria of the UFS sighting, you have come to the right place. As an example, if you wanted to see all sitings that have a shape of a triangle, you would go to the "Enter a Shape" input area on the left as you can see in the image below and enter "triangle".  To have the data populate, you would need to either hit enter or move to another input field.  You will notice that there is already inputs in the search area - these are just placeholders so that you have an example of the type of data to input.  If you take a close look at the example below, triangle is a darker color than the other fields meaning that the data is currently filtered on that condition.  You can also add to the filter by selecting any of the others categories and drilling down further into the sightings.  To clear your search, you would clear out or delete your data and either hit enter or move off of that input field.

**Summary**

Although I think we have come a long way with the UFO Sighting data, one drawback is being able to clear the search criteria all at once.

To advance this webpage, I would recommend adding a button to clear the search criteria.  Another item that I have noticed is that all of this data is related to the US.  Unless we were adding more data, I would remove that as search criteria so that people are not trying to search for other countries.  Another possibility would to have a drop down with the available countries so that the users had more of a feel for what is available for them to search on.
